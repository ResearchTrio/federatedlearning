# Federated Learning
We here implement the federated deep learning architecture to demonstrate the smart doorbell functionality.
   It is an attempt to mimic the scenario described in the paper [A Demonstration of Smart Doorbell Design Using FederatedDeep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09687.pdf)
