# Federated Learning
We here implement the Federated Deep Learning architecture to demonstrate the smart doorbell functionality.  
   It is an attempt to mimic the scenario described in the paper [A Demonstration of Smart Doorbell Design Using FederatedDeep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09687.pdf)
